  <h2>Scope</h2>
  <p>The International Workshop on Multiscale Multimodal Medical Imaging (MMMI) aims at tackling the important challenge of acquiring and analyzing medical images at multiple scales and/or from multiple modalities, which has been increasingly applied in research studies and clinical practice. MMMI offers an opportunity to present: 1) techniques involving multi-modal image acquisition and reconstruction, or imaging at multi-scales; 2) novel methodologies and insights of multiscale multimodal medical images analysis, including image fusing, multimodal augmentation, and joint inference; and 3) empirical studies involving the application of multiscale multimodal imaging for clinical use.</p>
  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>Facing the growing amount of data available from multiscale multimodal medical imaging facilities and a variety of new methods for the image analysis developed so far, the MMMI workshop aims to move forward the state of the art in multiscale multimodal medical imaging, including both algorithm development, implementation of the methodology, and experimental studies. The workshop also aims to facilitate more communications and interactions between researchers in medical image analysis and machine learning, especially expertise in data fusion, multi-fidelity methods, and multi-source learning.</p>
  <h2>Topics</h2>
  Topic of submissions to the workshop include, but not limited to: <br />
  <li>Image segmentation techniques based on multiscale multimodal images.</li>
  <li>Novel techniques in multiscale multimodal image acquisition and reconstruction.</li>
  <li>Registration methods across multiscale multimodal images.</li>
  <li>Fusion of images from multiple resolutions and novel visualization methods.</li>
  <li>Spatial-temporal analysis using multiple modalities.</li>
  <li>Fusion of image sources with different fidelities: e.g., co-analysis of EEG and fMRI.</li>
  <li>Multiscale multimodal disease classification and prediction using supervised or unsupervised methods.</li>
  <li>Atlas-based methods on multiple imaging modalities.</li>
  <li>Cross-modality image generative methods: e.g., generation of synthetic images between CT and MR.</li>
  <li>Novel radiomics methods based on multiscale multimodal imaging.</li>
  <li>Shape analysis on images from multiple sources and/or multiple resolutions.</li>
  <li>Graph methods in medical image analysis.</li>
  <li>Benchmark studies for multiscale multimodal image analysis: e.g., using electrophysiological signals for validation of fMRI data.</li>
  <li>Multi-view machine learning for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.</li>
  <li>Integrated radiology, pathology, genomics analysis via learning algorithms.</li>
  <li>New image biomarker identification through multiscale multimodal data.</li>
  <h2>History of MMMI</h2>
  <p>
  The 1st International Workshop on Multiscale Multimodal Medical Imaging (MMMI 2019) <a href="https://mmmi2019.github.io/">mmmi2019.github.io</a> recorded 80 attendees and received 18 full-pages submissions, with 13 accepted and presented. The theme of MMMI 2019 is on the emerging techniques for imaging and analyzing multi-modal, multi-scale data. The 2nd MMMI workshop was merged with MLCDS 2021 <a href="http://mcbr-cds.org/">mcbr-cds.org</a>, which recorded 58 attendees and received 16 full-pages submissions, with 10 accepted and presented. The theme of MLCDS 2021 was the role and prospect of multi-modal multi-scale imaging in clinical practice. As multi-modal multi-scale medical imaging is a fast-growing field, we are continuing the MMMI workshop to provide a platform for presenting and discussing novel research from both the radiology and computer science communities. In MMMI 2022, we will emphasize the current research and vision on the concept of “multi-scale,” as the field has been recognizing the importance of medical images across scales for the potential of a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of the imaging target.
