  <h2>Scope</h2>
  <p>The International Workshop on Multiscale Multimodal Medical Imaging (MMMI) aims at tackling the important challenge of acquiring and analyzing medical images at multiple scales and/or from multiple modalities, which has been increasingly applied in research studies and clinical practice. MMMI offers an opportunity to present: 1) techniques involving multi-modal image acquisition and reconstruction, or imaging at multi-scales; 2) novel methodologies and insights of multiscale multimodal medical images analysis, including image fusing, multimodal augmentation, and joint inference; and 3) empirical studies involving the application of multiscale multimodal imaging for clinical use.</p>
  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>Facing the growing amount of data available from multiscale multimodal medical imaging facilities and a variety of new methods for the image analysis developed so far, this MICCAI workshop aims to move the forward state of the art in multiscale multimodal medical imaging, including both algorithm development, implementation of the methodology, and experimental studies. The workshop also aims to facilitate more communications and interactions between researchers in the field of medical image analysis and the field of machine learning, especially with expertise in data fusion, multi-fidelity methods, and multi-source learning.</p>
  <h2>Topics</h2>
  Topic of submissions to the workshop include, but not limited to: <br />
  <li>Image segmentation techniques based on multiscale multimodal images</li>
  <li>Novel techniques in multiscale multimodal image acquisition and reconstruction</li>
  <li>Registration methods across multiscale multimodal images</li>
  <li>Fusion of images from multiple resolutions and novel visualization methods</li>
  <li>Spatial-temporal analysis using multiple modalities</li>
  <li>Fusion of image sources with different fidelities: e.g., co-analysis of EEG and fMRI</li>
  <li>Multiscale multimodal disease diagnosis/prognosis using supervised or unsupervised methods</li>
  <li>Atlas-based methods on multiple imaging modalities</li>
  <li>Cross-modality image generative methods: e.g., generation of synthetic CT/MR images</li>
  <li>Novel radiomics methods based on multiscale multimodal imaging</li>
  <li>Shape analysis on images from multiple sources and/or multiple resolutions</li>
  <li>Graph methods in medical image analysis</li>
  <li>Benchmark studies for multiscale multimodal image analysis: e.g., using electrophysiological signals to validate fMRI data</li>
  <li>Multi-view machine learning for cancer diagnosis and prognosis</li>
  <li>Integrated radiology, pathology, and genomics analysis via learning algorithms</li>
  <li>New image biomarker identification through multiscale multimodal data</li>
  <li>Integrated learning using both image and non-image data</li>

  <h2>History of MMMI</h2>
  <p>
  MMMI 2019 (https://mmmi2019.github.io/) recorded 80 attendees and received 18 8-pages submissions, with 13 accepted and presented. The theme of MMMI 2019 was the emerging techniques for imaging and analyzing multi-modal multi-scale data. The 2nd MMMI workshop was merged with MLCDS 2021 (http://mcbr-cds.org/), recorded 58 attendees, and received 16 8-pages submissions, with 10 of them accepted and presented. The theme of MLCDS 2021 was the role and prospect of multi-modal multi-scale imaging in clinical practice. The 3rd MMMI workshop recorded 64 attendees and received 18 8-pages submissions, with 12 of them accepted and presented. The theme of MMMI 2022 was the novel methodology development for multi-modal fusion. As multi-modal, multi-scale medical imaging is a fast-growing field; we are continuing the MMMI to provide a platform for presenting and discussing novel research from both the radiology and computer science communities. In MMMI 2023, weâ€™ll emphasize the current research and applications on multi-modal, multi-scale imaging in oncology, which is one of the largest research topics related to this field.

  <li>Authors should consult Springer <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/book-authors-editors/your-publication-journey/manuscript-preparation" target="_blank">authors guidelines</a> and use their proceedings templates, either for <a href="https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/20566/data/v11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LaTeX</a> or for <a href="https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/3318/data/v5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Word</a>, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their <a href="https://orcid.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ORCID</a> identifier in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form, which can be downloaded <a href="https://mmmi2023.github.io/CopyrightForm_LNCS_MMMI2023.docx">here</a>. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.</li>
  <h4><strong>Blind Review:</strong></h4>
  <li>Reviewing is <u>strictly double blind</u>: authors do not know the names of the reviewers of their papers, and reviewers do not know the names of the authors. Please see the <strong>anonymity guidelines</strong> of MICCAI 2023 for detailed explanations of how to ensure this.</li>
  <h4><strong>Supplemental Material</strong></h4>
  <li>Supplemental material submission is optional. This material may include: videos of results that cannot be included in the main paper anonymized related submissions to other conferences and journals, and appendices or technical reports containing extended proofs and mathematical derivations that are not essential for understanding of the paper. Contents of the supplemental material should be referred to appropriately in the paper and the reviewers are not obliged to look at it.</li>
  <h4><strong>Simultaneous Submission</strong></h4>
  <li>Our policy is that in submitting a paper, authors implicitly acknowledge that NO paper of substantially similar content has been or will be submitted to another conference or workshop until MMMI decisions are made.</li>
